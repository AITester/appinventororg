          <p>(25) Name and define three ways in which the Android platform is more open than iOS (iPhone). Which of these is key to why App Inventor was developed for Android?</p>

          Android is more open than iOS in the following ways: 
          <ul><li>Android is open source. Programmers can access the program source code and change it, making a new app. It is the Android OS itself which is open source, not (necessarily) Android apps.</li>
          </li><li>  Android is open for use by hardware vendors: Any company can make mobile devices for Android. </li>
          <li>  Android is an open distribution. It is easy to publish apps on the market and, unlike with Apple (iOS) you can also publish apps on the web and distribute them over email. </li></ul>
          Android's open distribution is  the key reason why App Inventor was developed with Android instead of iOS. It allows students to build samples and unrefined apps and share them with other students, their teacher, their family and friends, etc.

          <h2>2.</h2>
         (50) Sketch the blocks for an app that:
          <p style="margin: 20px;">a.  Has one button, Button1 </br>
             b.  The image on the button toggles between three images each time you click. First it shows Obama, then Romney, then Clinton, then Obama again, and so on. Assume the images are named obama.jpg, romney.jpg, and clinton.jpg.

        b.  The parameters of a function provide the information the function needs to perform its job, e.g., how long it should vibrate.
