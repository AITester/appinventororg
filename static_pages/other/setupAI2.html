  <h1>App Inventor 2: The Fastest Way to Build an Android App</h1>
  <p>It usually takes a few hours to set up any app development environment. Even App Inventor Classic had some issues! With App Inventor 2, things are dramatically different. <em>if you have a WiFi connection, a computer and a phone, you can get setup within minutes.</em></p>
  <h3>The 2 Minute Solution</h3>
  <p>The following steps, also illustrated in the video to the right, will work for most people whether you are at home or office/school. If you are at a school/office with restrictions on WiFi access, check-out the troubleshooting link below. 
  <ul>
    <li>You need not download anything to your computer</li>
    <li>In your computer's browser, go to <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu">ai2.appinventor.mit.edu</a></li>
    <li>You'll be prompted to download the MIT AI2 Companion app, by scanning the provided QR code or by going to the Play Store. The Companion app is just an Android App that lets you test the apps you build as you're building them. Install it on your phone and start it up.
   <li> Back on your computer, click on 'Blocks' to go to the 'Blocks' window, click on 'Connect' and 'Connect to Companion', and you'll see the app you're building on your device. This is fun!</li>
   </ul>
  <h3>Troubleshooting </h3>
  <p>Though the WiFi connection is the fastest and easiest way to use App Inventor 2, the tool does provide alternatives including connecting your phone to the computer with a USB cable and using an emulator. For help with either of these, please see the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup.html">setup instructions</a> on the MIT App Inventor site.
