<h1>Creating your Class Portfolio</h1>
<p>
These notes describe how to create a "class portfolio" for the work you do in class. You'll learn how to create a Google Sites page and from this day on you'll post everything you do-- from small lab assignments to large, creative projects-- on your portfolio. These are the reasons for the portfolio:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You'll be creating something that your classmates and others can view and learn from.
</li>
<li>    
You can continue to work on projects when the course ends.
</li>
<li> 
    You can refer back to the samples and projects as you progress through the course.
</li>
<li> 
    One outcome of the class is a portfolio you can show family, friends, and prospective employers.
</li>
<li> 
    Google Sites is a nice "cloud computing" tool to learn.
</li>
</ul>
Here's an <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/josephinelisportfolio/"> example of a student portfolio</a> from the Fall 2012 course
 
<h3>Google Sites: The Wiki Stored in the Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li>
    wysiwyg -- you don't have to know HTML to edit
</li>
<li>
    Collaborative-- you define who can edit pages. Maybe its just you, or a group, or everyone (e.g., Wikipedia)
</li>
<li>
    Stored in the cloud (on Google's servers)
</li>
<li>
    You can create a site instantly and create as many as you'd like for free.
</li>
<li>
    You don't have to download any software or have any systems-level  or HTML knowledge
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tutorial: Create your course portfolio page.</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Get a Google Account and Register for Sites. In a browser, go to sites.google.com. If you have a Google account login. If not, click 'Sign up for Sites' and register with Google.
</li>
<li>
Create a New Site. When you've successfully logged in to Google Sites do the following:
<ul>
<li>
 Click on 'Create new Site'
</li>
<li>
Provide a name for your site,  something like 'Joe Smith's App Inventor Site'. Note that the id (not the name) must be unique as it will be part of your URL.
</li>
<li>
Choose the default theme for now. You can change it later.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Add some basic information to the home page.
To add or change information to your home page, click on "Edit Page" in the top-right corner (if you're already in Edit mode, Save and Cancel buttons will appear in the top-right corner). On your new home page, add some profile information for yourself:
<ul>

<li>
    name and contact information
</li>
<li>
    short bio
</li>
<li>
    something about the course you are taking.
</li>
</ul>
Then click 'Save'. 
</li>
<li>
Insert a profile image on your home page
You can insert images on to your page either from a file on your computer, or from the web. First, insert an image from  the web. Open another browser window and search Google images for a picture you like (go to http://images.google.com/ to search the web for images). When you have found an image you like, right click on it and select 'Copy Image Location'. This will put the image link in your copy clipboard. To make the image appear on your Google Sites page, first make sure you are in 'Edit' mode, then select Insert | Image from the top menu. You can then either choose to upload an image from your desktop or enter a URL for a picture on the web.
If you click on 'Web Address (URL)' you can then paste the URL you copied to your clipboard into theImage URL box. The same image that appeared in the Google Image search should appear on your new Google Sites page.
</li>
<li>
You can also insert an image from the hard drive of the computer. If you have a picture of yourself, great. Perhaps you can use a digital camera to take a picture of yourself and then email it yourself and upload it on the computer. If you don't want to do this right now, just go back to the Google image search and find another image from the web. This time, however, right click it and select "Save Image As". Save the file onto the desktop of your computer. Click Insert | Image again, and browse for the image you want on your Google Sites page. When you click 'Add Image' it should appear on your page.
</li>

<li>
Customize the Sidebar. The sidebar appears on all the pages of your site. You can customize it with different items and links, and even move it around on the page.
Choose More | edit site layout. Then click on the sidebar. A dialog will appear allowing you to add pages to the sidebar. By default,  "Automatically organize" will be selected. Unselect this so you can control what appears. Then add the pages you want. Eventually, you'll add links to your major projects and checklists.
</li>
<li>
You can also add links to the outside world and other items in the sidebar. You'll have to create a new sidebar item, different from Navigation. Create it by choosing + in the sidebar, then choose the "Text" type. This allows you to put in any components, including links. Add this Text navigation below the navigation bar and add links to your profiles on facebook, etc. and to the course web page.
</li>
</ol>

<li>
Change the logo on your site. In a drawing editor, create a logo. It might have your picture on it, or just a nicely styled title. Create your logo of dimensions something like 750x140 to fit into a Google Sites page.
Add it to your site by choosing Manage Site in the top-right "more actions" menu, then choosing change layout and update logo.
</li>
</ul>
