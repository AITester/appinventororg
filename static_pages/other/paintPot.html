<H1>PaintPot: Build, Conceptualize, Customize</H1>
<br/>

<h2> Build It</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Open a browser and navigate to <a href="http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu">http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu</a>. Login with your Google account.
</li>
<li>
Now build the PaintPot painting app. Follow the instructions in App Inventor chapter 2 using either the paperback version, the <a href="/apps/paintpot/paintpot.pdf">pdf version</a>, or the <a href="/paintpot">step-by-step video lesson</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conceptualize It</h2>
 <div class="row-fluid">
<div class="span6">
<p>After completing the PaintPot tutorial, discuss these questions with a partner or small group, jotting down notes while you discuss. Later, create a portfolio page with answers to the questions in your own words.
Topics: Canvases and drawing, event parameters

<ol>
<li>
A number of event-handlers are involved with lines being drawn a particular color. Circle them in the blocks to the right.
</li>
<li>
There are event parameters for some of the events handlers. Name the events with event parameters and describe the data each parameter holds.
</li>

<li>
 How are event parameters different than function call parameters (e.g., Draw.Line(x,y,5) or Sound.Vibrate (500) from HelloPurr) ? Who specifies function parameters? Who specifies event parameters?
</li>

<li>
What variable is defined in PaintPot?</li>
<li>
Circle the blocks used to define the variable in PaintPot. Once you define a variable, what blocks appear in "My Definitions"
</li>
<li>
Sketch how the app's memory changes when you define a variable?
</li>
<li>
You don't need to define a variable for 'PaintColor', the color of the paint on the canvas. Why not?
</li>
<li>
Define the term variable. How is a variable similar to a property? How is a variable different than a property?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
One customization of PaintPot involves using a Textbox for the dotsize.  How is a textbox different from a variable? How is a textbox different from a label?
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Customize It</h2>
<p>Note: these variations are slightly modified from the book version.
<ol>
<li>
The user interface does not display the current color. Modify the app so that when the user changes color, the chosen button's color is modified.</li>
<li>The dot size used for circle drawing can only be 2 or 8. Change this so that the user can enter the dot size within a TextBox component and thus change it to other values besides 2 and 8. For more information on input forms and the TextBox component, see the No Texting While Driving app of <a href="no-text-while-driving">Chapter 4</a>
</li>
</ol>
